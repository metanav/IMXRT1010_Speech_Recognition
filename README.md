# IMXRT1010 Speech Recognition
In this project I built an application around a model trained to recognize words left, right, up, and down. All it does is capture and process audio, feed it into a TensorFlow Lite model, and display the output on an OLED display. I will give a walk through to set up and do machine learning at the edge using i.MXR1010 evaluation kit.
